3,35,0,Ben LeBlanc,"Yeah, I guess for me that's got a cool thing about, you know, American General and you know nonprofits is that you know, people think it's a good thing then they will donate their own money towards it about taking that like we shouldn't be no use different services in at local local T's shouldn't use nonprofit services.",1.0,-1
3,35,1,Ben LeBlanc,"But you know, if people want this to happen, then you know, they can give their own money I guess.",0.0,-1
3,36,0,Georgia Smith,"I think of anything for this too is that a lot of illegal immigrants always say it's hard to become a citizen like there's not enough services or they don't know how to do it.",-2.0,1
3,36,1,Georgia Smith,"So nonprofits like this could go they got for them, becoming actually legal citizens.",1.0,1

3,38,1,Hunter Seay,"I feel like I feel like States like Texas and like like near Mexico would just be paying all the money and then how is that fair to the like the rest?",1.0,-1
3,38,2,Hunter Seay,"I was afraid of Texas compared to like New York or you're not going to get a whole bunch of illegal immigrants.",1.0,-1
3,39,0,Davis Wendzel,"I definitely agree with that, but I'm just not sure I like the local government would be donating and I agree that we think that these people should have their own money and give it to the give it to these nonprofits, but I'm just not sure how many people would donate their own money to these nonprofits over like a cancer hospital or Children's Hospital.",1.0,1
3,40,0,Cali Cox,"I okay, so I haven't spoken yet, but kind of going off what bed and Grant and a couple of them had said I I think another thing you have to look at is that it's saying local government should allocate this and seeing that immigration and a lot of these issues are having to do a federal laws and a lot more of this about a federal level.",-2.0,1
3,40,1,Cali Cox,"I think that that is something you should think about and think about what our local government should be funding.",0.0,1
3,41,0,Grant Seiter,"Yeah, so I kind of think it's interesting that you brought that up Connor about there being a difference between locality.",1.0,0
3,41,1,Grant Seiter,"So like how is that fair to the immigrants in New Mexico supposed to taxes?",1.0,1

4,42,0,Mason Turner,"Squatting the main issue with this is if they are coming over illegally in the first place.",0.0,-1
4,42,1,Mason Turner,"There's really no way to track and document how long they've been here.",0.0,-1
4,42,2,Mason Turner,"So you're just assuming that they've been here for 10 years and I just don't think that's right.",-1.0,-1
4,43,0,Davis Wendzel,"I think it's also tricky one because when it's illegal immigrants come over it's kind of just incentivizing them to stay as long as they possibly can and until then then then we'll be able to become citizens.",1.0,-1
4,43,1,Davis Wendzel,"I think it should just be making it easier process to become a citizen set of taking 10 to 12 years.",-1.0,-1
4,45,0,Grant Seiter,"I think is the debate is mostly about people who are already here.",0.0,0
4,45,1,Grant Seiter,"Not saying we're not going to control the the border for future people.",0.0,0
4,45,2,Grant Seiter,"So it's not saying for future folks who come over illegally and then say here for 10 years congrats your granted immunity.",2.0,0
4,45,3,Grant Seiter,"It's for the folks who have been here for 10 years because of our lack of security before so what do we do with those some, you know, 20 million immigrants",-1.0,0
4,46,0,Cali Cox,"I kind of agree with Davis in the fact that if they've already been here for 10 years and I mean there's obviously something not lining up that they will be a faster process for this if they've already been here for 10 years and they're not able to become a legal citizen then.",1.0,-1
4,46,1,Cali Cox,"Yeah, then there's just a whole nother problem.",-1.0,-1
4,47,0,Alissa Sanchez,"I really like the point that Grant brought up.",1.0,1
4,47,1,Alissa Sanchez,"I think that one of the main things is they already here and a lot of them to have children that have grown up in our system and then they're running into this problem would like to putting their parents and then the sometimes like the children also getting deported if they were born here, then they're not going to do it just like causes that tension and so I definitely think that this is a tricky one because it is hard to measure how long they've been here.",0.0,1
4,47,2,Alissa Sanchez,"But at the same time it could probably help with some of the tension that were even experiencing now with people getting deported.",1.0,1
4,47,3,Alissa Sanchez,"So I definitely think that's something to eat.",0.0,1
4,48,0,Grant Seiter,"So my question for you all maybe would be what are the cons to not granting immunity to these individuals is it just a symptom are like nationalism or patriotism patriotism her sense of justice that perhaps it's because they were legal in the first place.",0.0,1
4,48,1,Grant Seiter,"They don't deserve it, But what are the cons of granting took citizenship?",-1.0,1
4,48,2,Grant Seiter,"They're already here.",0.0,1
4,49,0,Ryan Paxton,"El Gran that's really good question, but I also think there's an underlying issue.",2.0,0
4,49,1,Ryan Paxton,"I think that.",0.0,0
4,50,0,Mason Turner,"Tell me I'm not really saying I have a problem with it.",1.0,-1
4,50,1,Mason Turner,"It's just mainly the fact that there's no way to regulate it because you know looking back at the other issues if victims aren't willing to come forward because they don't want their status speed seen that how can we assume that when they come over here?",1.0,-1
4,50,2,Mason Turner,"It'll be like, okay, like I've been here since you know 96, so I should be become leave at this point.",0.0,-1
4,51,0,Ben LeBlanc,"Christine McConnell just granted immunity rate for for everyone instead of kind of incentivizes them to come over illegally which could cause all sorts of issues down.",1.0,1
4,51,1,Ben LeBlanc,"I guess where they're Crossing in that area.",0.0,1
4,51,2,Ben LeBlanc,"I guess it's kind of hard for me not to be at least a little bit apathetic about the people that are here 10 years cuz if they've been here 10 years and they haven't made a big Ruckus that has it really affected my life.",2.0,1
4,51,3,Ben LeBlanc,"I don't know.",0.0,0
4,52,0,Davis Wendzel,"I think for me it's that the they've been here for 10 years and they haven't tried to really become part of the country.",0.0,-1
4,52,1,Davis Wendzel,"Maybe if they have started the process of becoming a citizen that's different.",1.0,-1
4,52,2,Davis Wendzel,"But these people haven't even tried to learn English or becoming too ingrained in the American culture.",-1.0,-1
4,52,3,Davis Wendzel,"I just think it's hard to just let them be part of our country.",0.0,-1
4,53,0,Grant Seiter,"I think the problem with that statement is the fact that if they were to try it goes back to her initial two issues if they were to say hi.",-1.0,0
4,53,1,Grant Seiter,"I'd like to become a citizen of they and they were to do so in that the Houston office and they say, oh, where do you live you live here, but you're a document that goes back to the same kind of circular problem as before they would have to be deported until their papers went through the process.",0.0,0
4,53,2,Grant Seiter,"So in trying to become a citizen if they've already been here for 10 years, they're subject to the same legal proceedings of someone who came over yesterday.",1.0,0
