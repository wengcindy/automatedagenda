0,9,0,Sneha Bhavanasi,"I don't think it matters if it's illegal immigrant or not reporting a crime because the fact is that first of all, we want to keep our country safe and its crimes are being reported in general.",1.0,-1
0,9,1,Sneha Bhavanasi,"It's going to cause an even bigger problem and like Laura Lee said it's going to start causing people to Target people who are undocumented cuz they know that people are not going to East crimes and if that happens is just going to it's going to cause even more of a mess and a huge Target in our country.",-1.0,-1

1,12,0,Sneha Bhavanasi,"I think it's just talking about a witness to any crime.",-2.0,0

1,13,1,Joie Hensley,"Yeah, so yeah, it says of a witness to a crime but we also have to take into account like what crime is actually being committed and what they're witnessing and I think that they should be allowed in certain circumstances, but it should if they're actually like testifying in court then it should be able to testify in court and then potentially go back.",-1.0,1

1,15,1,Lauralee Jackson,"Like I feel like they the police officer should be able to ask if like what the severity of the crime but I don't want to be like asking then have them deported like if they're able to help in this sort of like case or whatever the crime was then they should at least the police officers should try to get them some sort of documentation or help them like join the country legally that I don't know.",0.0,-1

1,16,1,Payton Burnett,"Yeah, I agree.",1.0,0
1,16,2,Payton Burnett,"I think it definitely does need to be addressed and it should be a lot for them to ask but I think for the purpose of getting them on a sort of list to become a legal citizen just to get rid of this problem in general cuz this is a huge issue and if it's not a dress it's like nothing's going to change.",-1.0,1

1,17,1,Lee Deckard,"Why do you think people are afraid to be deported even though they could possibly become a legal citizen is at this because of lack of knowledge or like what are we I'm confused why minutes little contradicted extinct",0.0,0
1,18,0,Sneha Bhavanasi,"So especially in this country.",0.0,-1

1,18,2,Sneha Bhavanasi,"And then if you're deported and then you tried to come here legally, it could take even longer and it's not really like a reasonable timeframe, which is why I feel like a lot of people don't even attempt to go the legal route because it's way harder than it needs to be.",0.0,-1

1,19,1,Ryan Bertelsman,"Is it approximately six months?",0.0,0
1,19,2,Ryan Bertelsman,"So, I mean, I don't know either way like how long it takes but I think that is another issue that could definitely be handled better.",1.0,0
2,20,0,Lee Deckard,"One time I think I see with dishes if we're just assigning somebody that too and to an immigration case like this.",0.0,0
2,20,1,Lee Deckard,"They possibly could not want to try as hard especially if they have a bias towards this type of topic.",1.0,0

2,20,3,Lee Deckard,"I I think it's a good idea.",1.0,1

2,23,1,Jonny Berry,"I'll take it the porter.",0.0,-1
2,23,2,Jonny Berry,"Not just that kind of situation.",0.0,-1
2,24,0,Charlie Emmett,"So it looks like it's according to the second Pro hiding legal counsel for immigration proceedings to keep them here.",0.0,0
2,24,1,Charlie Emmett,"Which would mean.",0.0,0
2,26,0,Sneha Bhavanasi,"I think regardless I mean I understand that the constitution says that we don't owe them anything because they're not here legally and that makes sense definitely but then you also have to look at it as a thing of fairness and Justice and realize that like a lot of people who are going through these cases just don't understand what's happening.",1.0,1
2,26,1,Sneha Bhavanasi,"Like the first pro talks about how it involves complex legal questions that a lot of undocumented immigrants don't know how to navigate and maybe representation isn't the right way to help them.",0.0,1

2,27,3,Morgan Evans,"But but I agree that it my gut feelings.",1.0,1
2,27,4,Morgan Evans,"You can't just give them no rights because they aren't citizens doesn't seem completely fair.",-1.0,1
2,27,5,Morgan Evans,"But I do agree that maybe giving him all of the same equal rights might not be a fair solution either so I'm not actually sure what to do.",1.0,-1
2,28,0,Jessie Benson,"Yeah, I agree with both of them.",1.0,0

2,29,0,Lee Deckard,"Maybe of a possible.",0.0,0
2,29,1,Lee Deckard,"It's very basic solution to this would be to find a group of people who volunteer maybe to help in these cases and said just assign people in that case.",1.0,0
2,29,2,Lee Deckard,"They would be the ones that want to help them out instead of just saying or we don't deserve there or we don't we don't have to give them help maybe they're just people that want to volunteer and try to give them help just because they feel like they should",1.0,0
2,30,0,Charlie Emmett,"Yeah, I agree with we as people want to do that on their own time.",1.0,0
2,30,1,Charlie Emmett,"They're more than welcome to do that.",0.0,0
2,30,2,Charlie Emmett,"I just don't think that government funds should go towards providing counsel.",-1.0,-1
2,31,0,Ryan Bertelsman,"yeah, I don't I mean I definitely think that you legal immigrants should have the same rights as legal citizens, but I think I don't think you should just say, like screw all immigrants send them back, but I don't know it's kind of finding outline of like Together breaking this law is being broken.",-1.0,1
2,31,1,Ryan Bertelsman,"Like what's going to be like the free pass for the for the next ball to be broken or it's kind of like well, there's leeway in this one.",1.0,0
2,31,2,Ryan Bertelsman,"So, how can we be flexible with breaking the next law?",-1.0,0
3,32,0,Lee Deckard,"Maybe instead of because I know where all the some people are big on not having the government find this type of thing.",0.0,0
3,32,1,Lee Deckard,"So maybe instead of local government allocate in finding a less.",0.0,-1
3,32,2,Lee Deckard,"That means like people donating their own money.",1.0,-1
3,32,3,Lee Deckard,"What if like I said what if people just don't either on money instead of the government to he's not local nonprofits if they wanted to provide some type of legal service to these people.",-1.0,-1
3,33,0,Charlie Emmett,"I think that's a really good solution to this.",2.0,0
3,33,1,Charlie Emmett,"I'd see no reason why we should keep people from putting money where they want to put their own money.",0.0,0

3,33,3,Charlie Emmett,"It should be used to benefit citizens.",2.0,-1
3,34,0,Lauralee Jackson,"I think this is one of the topics that I had like the most problems with like trying to figure out where I was and what I thought was like right because I definitely like agree with like number 5 on the against like nonprofits have a lot of other means to raise money for like how they go about their services and I don't necessarily think that like local governments should do this may be like on a national federal level, but I'm like, well that not everyone would be able to go to like a federal or national government type thing.",-2.0,-1
3,34,1,Lauralee Jackson,"So, I don't know this is where I see like her problems like local versus national debt.",2.0,-1
3,35,0,Lee Deckard,"What if there was one of the original nonprofit that was created just for this type of situation and not maybe take away money from other nonprofits that are mainly for other things besides providing on providing immigration people Legal Services.",1.0,1
3,36,0,Morgan Evans,"How many could work but I guess then the question comes back to you or they going to be finding themselves or their should some up at the government defining them and I'm I'm I'm a little unsure on this one too.",-1.0,0
3,36,1,Morgan Evans,"But I think they I feel like local government for me my back to be a better solution than federal government just cuz it seems like an issue that might be more well handled at the local level instead of trying to handle such a big bra tissue from top down like it might be a little bit better if you do it from the local government.",2.0,1

4,38,0,Ryan Bertelsman,"I think that's kind of the argument though is like the people who have been here for fifty or sixty years and haven't committed any crimes and they should be rewarded for that and not send backer should be able to feel safe about coming up coming forward and getting some kind of.",-1.0,1

4,41,0,Joie Hensley,"I do agree that we should make like a legal pathway for citizen to her over here who are here for illegal immigrants are here for 10 years, but I think that if you guys look at the 4th to call on it says if undocumented immigrants come to the country by illegally crossing the border.",-1.0,-1
4,41,1,Joie Hensley,"It is difficult for undocumented immigrant to provide evidence that they have been in the country for a specific time.",-1.0,-1
