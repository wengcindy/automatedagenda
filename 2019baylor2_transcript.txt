Hunter Seay: All right, so I do not believe in this I don't believe this is necessary because his victims were to report that they were illegal.
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: There'd be more crimes that would happen because they they wouldn't come forward and say that they were illegal cuz no one don't believe any immigrant wants to get morning.
Sentiment score: -2

Alissa Sanchez: I agree with that.
Sentiment score: 1

Alissa Sanchez: I think that by allowing to do that people are going to be less likely to recur report when there's actually crime and I think it just instills fear in general.
Sentiment score: -2

Grant Seiter: I think one thing is the question kind of the central tendency around it is whether or not they should be allowed to this really doesn't have any bearing on whether or not I think that should be the case.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: But at least looking at at National Law should our Enforcement Officers be allowed to enforce it think I see the opposite side of this this
Sentiment score: 1

Georgia Smith: I think that maybe not police officers should have the right but like certain officials should have the right to do this.
Sentiment score: 0

Alissa Sanchez: Georgia when you say other kind of officials like who
Sentiment score: 1

Georgia Smith: I think it probably be like the government would have to issue.
Sentiment score: 0

Georgia Smith: I mean not exactly Polly every single police officer.
Sentiment score: 0

Georgia Smith: But if there's like immigration Specialist or like what it was like at the border or something like that just those kinds of officials not necessarily like everyday police officers that I was going over for like speeding tickets or what not.
Sentiment score: 1

Georgia Smith: I think this goes on like the last one except his four Witnesses.
Sentiment score: 0

Georgia Smith: I think it'll make that Witnesses won't come forward if they are illegal or not, but it could have like a Sentimental effect on the outcome of the crime if they don't come forward.
Sentiment score: -1

Mason Turner: Yeah, I agree with that cuz I got to witness you're not doing anything wrong at the moment.
Sentiment score: 1

Mason Turner: So I don't see why we should put somebody in Jeopardy for coming out and speaking and I'm saying I saw some wrong.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: Turn on the last item that we did or knowing like the identity of the person was something that was important for either victim or witness.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: And so I don't know how much their immigration status effects of being able to contact them, you know if they needed to go to trial.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: Would be but there was something that they told us to think about.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: Additionally, we talked a lot about the incentives of whether or not they would want to testify and while I think there's a strong argument for that.
Sentiment score: -2

Grant Seiter: Unfortunately, there aren't any numbers or statistic for this has been measured if it actually isn't sent it.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: So it's hard to say what the actual outcome could be.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: It could be that in general people are just good people and there could be some even if your if you ask the question of whether whether immigration status is there could be some kind of witness protection involved in that where they give like a Alleyway time.
Sentiment score: 1

Alissa Sanchez: I guess kind of almost a question I have for the group is like when I look at this and I'm kind of thinking through it.
Sentiment score: 1

Alissa Sanchez: I wonder like what's the actual benefit of asking for immigration status?
Sentiment score: 2

Alissa Sanchez: Like it kind of seems like just a way to profile someone during like what's the actual benefit of even asking in the first place?
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: I mean kind of like been mentioned earlier there wouldn't be an information asymmetry between the witness add.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: Let's say the jury who is hearing this this testimony, you know, the person is from their able to be contacted by the prosecution and the defense you're a witness to a crime and police officers taking down your record on the report, but you failed to provide contact information or what your legal status is Perhaps Perhaps, that could be negatively if he's in are called to testify by the end of the prosecution in court.
Sentiment score: 1

Georgia Smith: A plant also brings up is that like criminal activity involving undocumented immigrants will be reduced if like law enforcement is consistent with identifying these immigrants.
Sentiment score: -1

Georgia Smith: I think to me like the biggest argument here is that like if these immigrants should have the same rights to?
Sentiment score: -1

Georgia Smith: like have the same rights as actual citizens vs. Non-citizens.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: So I'm not exactly sure who appoints the lawyers, but it may be that I'll just ask that does anyone know who appointed lawyers.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: I know that it said like in National states are is it cities that appointees lawyers?
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: If it is then it could just be that it's a local, you know Case by case.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: It depends on what level by of course, they're at so if it's like a local civil court, it will be your local defendant.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: So your York County Defender that's employed by the simple populace.
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: I agree with you Georgia.
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: But the one thing about them having equal rights is we're going to have to ever turn all going to have to have.
Sentiment score: 0

Hunter Seay: Like most of them don't have the ability to hire their own attorneys.
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: So if it's going to get really costly and it's going to cost a lot more than if they were to just not.
Sentiment score: 0

Hunter Seay: Be appointed by.
Sentiment score: 0

Hunter Seay: Bayou a drink
Sentiment score: 0

Mason Turner: Yeah, I kind of agree with Hunter like one of the main issues with this is just the money factor of it.
Sentiment score: 1

Mason Turner: Like should we be spending our own tax dollars on allowing these people to have public defenders?
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Paxton: Haven to go along with Mason I do agree with the money factor.
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Paxton: I think that we have kind of other needs that we need to be focusing on and we need to focus on our self.
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Paxton: I think that's definitely I think that's is also a factor, going along with me soon.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: The other thing is just looking back at the history of due process law in the Fifth Amendment is what establishes who gets the right to a jury and the phrasing on that is just no person shall it doesn't no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law.
Sentiment score: -2

Grant Seiter: So if you're looking at that literally person doesn't just imply Citizen and also that has roots in the Magna Carta which was kind of the governing document of of all of Europe in the new world also was use the term free man to describe person.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: So if you're taking those literally than that would also include undocumented immigrants.
Sentiment score: 0

Alissa Sanchez: I can like see the perspective that comes from the money issue because we do have to think about like what we're spending our tax dollars on but I think Grant also just made a really good.
Sentiment score: 2

Alissa Sanchez: We also kind of have to think about like what our values are is a country and you know like freedom for everyone and not just ourselves and I think that that at least on that side of the argument is something that people argue is that they should have that right because they are also human beings with human rights who should be represented in court.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: Under the money saying all so you kind of have to look at the the cost-benefit analysis of an if they do get deported.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: What's the cost of that?
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: You know, and it could it be the case that over the grand scheme of things if I'm down to undocumented immigrants are appointed counsel and the majority are allowed to stay or whatever.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: The result is.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: Could that be in that save over the cost of deportation or hold them in some kind of jail or other penetentiary until they are deported.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: I don't know what the answer that is.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: So I think there is a strong argument here for the look up local allergies or you know, the people at the levels were supporting the lawyer's to have the ability to decide whether or not they're going to point lawyers or not.
Sentiment score: -1

Ben LeBlanc: I think some cities will and some cities were just depending on where they are the city that's in you know, Iowa since going to be different than a city that's you know On the Border, New Mexico.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: And so there's something out there.

Davis Wendzel: I think it's similar to the last question where we have to just decide if we think that us taxpayers should pay for an immigrant's.
Sentiment score: 0

Davis Wendzel: Immigrants needs that are not paying taxes.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: Another thing on that same point is if the funding is going to nonprofits whose purpose is to provide counsel for illegal Immigration Services, then why is it necessary that there's funding anyhow, I could be like a if y'all if you're familiar with, so would you like the court appointed special Advocate?
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: That's for I think it's children abused and neglected children to their volunteer lawyers who spend their time advocating for these people so there could be a system that could exist like that for illegal Immigration Services.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: I think there's probably not interested long enough lawyers the United States back to work.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: Yeah, I guess for me that's got a cool thing about, you know, American General and you know nonprofits is that you know, people think it's a good thing then they will donate their own money towards it about taking that like we shouldn't be no use different services in at local local T's shouldn't use nonprofit services.
Sentiment score: 1

Ben LeBlanc: But you know, if people want this to happen, then you know, they can give their own money I guess.
Sentiment score: 0

Georgia Smith: I think of anything for this too is that a lot of illegal immigrants always say it's hard to become a citizen like there's not enough services or they don't know how to do it.
Sentiment score: -2

Georgia Smith: So nonprofits like this could go they got for them, becoming actually legal citizens.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: Open with been on this one of my general simplified philosophy of government is just to do things that the majority of people want to do, but can't do it alone.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: And I think this is probably something that we could do alone.
Sentiment score: 0

Hunter Seay: Yeah, I totally agree with Grant just because I feel like it does aloe in like if local government was like if states were required to pay for the funding.
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: I feel like I feel like States like Texas and like like near Mexico would just be paying all the money and then how is that fair to the like the rest?
Sentiment score: 1

Hunter Seay: I was afraid of Texas compared to like New York or you're not going to get a whole bunch of illegal immigrants.
Sentiment score: 1

Davis Wendzel: I definitely agree with that, but I'm just not sure I like the local government would be donating and I agree that we think that these people should have their own money and give it to the give it to these nonprofits, but I'm just not sure how many people would donate their own money to these nonprofits over like a cancer hospital or Children's Hospital.
Sentiment score: 1

Cali Cox: I okay, so I haven't spoken yet, but kind of going off what bed and Grant and a couple of them had said I I think another thing you have to look at is that it's saying local government should allocate this and seeing that immigration and a lot of these issues are having to do a federal laws and a lot more of this about a federal level.
Sentiment score: -2

Cali Cox: I think that that is something you should think about and think about what our local government should be funding.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: Yeah, so I kind of think it's interesting that you brought that up Connor about there being a difference between locality.
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: So like how is that fair to the immigrants in New Mexico supposed to taxes?
Sentiment score: 1

Grant Seiter: The reason that's interesting is because that's the same debate that we had in the 90s with abortion rights in life.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: Sternberg V Carhart and Roe v. Wade was there these localities with Planned Parenthood who were offering abortion proceedings, but some people can't travel, you know, a hundred miles to get an abortion.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: So how is that fair to the person in Cincinnati who can versus the one in Ohio who can't Cincinnati?
Sentiment score: 1

Mason Turner: Squatting the main issue with this is if they are coming over illegally in the first place.
Sentiment score: 0

Mason Turner: There's really no way to track and document how long they've been here.
Sentiment score: 0

Mason Turner: So you're just assuming that they've been here for 10 years and I just don't think that's right.
Sentiment score: -1

Davis Wendzel: I think it's also tricky one because when it's illegal immigrants come over it's kind of just incentivizing them to stay as long as they possibly can and until then then then we'll be able to become citizens.
Sentiment score: 1

Davis Wendzel: I think it should just be making it easier process to become a citizen set of taking 10 to 12 years.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: I think is the debate is mostly about people who are already here.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: Not saying we're not going to control the the border for future people.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: So it's not saying for future folks who come over illegally and then say here for 10 years congrats your granted immunity.
Sentiment score: 2

Grant Seiter: It's for the folks who have been here for 10 years because of our lack of security before so what do we do with those some, you know, 20 million immigrants
Sentiment score: -1

Cali Cox: I kind of agree with Davis in the fact that if they've already been here for 10 years and I mean there's obviously something not lining up that they will be a faster process for this if they've already been here for 10 years and they're not able to become a legal citizen then.
Sentiment score: 1

Cali Cox: Yeah, then there's just a whole nother problem.
Sentiment score: -1

Alissa Sanchez: I really like the point that Grant brought up.
Sentiment score: 1

Alissa Sanchez: I think that one of the main things is they already here and a lot of them to have children that have grown up in our system and then they're running into this problem would like to putting their parents and then the sometimes like the children also getting deported if they were born here, then they're not going to do it just like causes that tension and so I definitely think that this is a tricky one because it is hard to measure how long they've been here.
Sentiment score: 0

Alissa Sanchez: But at the same time it could probably help with some of the tension that were even experiencing now with people getting deported.
Sentiment score: 1

Alissa Sanchez: So I definitely think that's something to eat.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: So my question for you all maybe would be what are the cons to not granting immunity to these individuals is it just a symptom are like nationalism or patriotism patriotism her sense of justice that perhaps it's because they were legal in the first place.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: They don't deserve it, But what are the cons of granting took citizenship?
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: They're already here.
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Paxton: El Gran that's really good question, but I also think there's an underlying issue.
Sentiment score: 2

Ryan Paxton: I think that.
Sentiment score: 0

Mason Turner: Tell me I'm not really saying I have a problem with it.
Sentiment score: 1

Mason Turner: It's just mainly the fact that there's no way to regulate it because you know looking back at the other issues if victims aren't willing to come forward because they don't want their status speed seen that how can we assume that when they come over here?
Sentiment score: 1

Mason Turner: It'll be like, okay, like I've been here since you know 96, so I should be become leave at this point.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: Christine McConnell just granted immunity rate for for everyone instead of kind of incentivizes them to come over illegally which could cause all sorts of issues down.
Sentiment score: 1

Ben LeBlanc: I guess where they're Crossing in that area.
Sentiment score: 0

Ben LeBlanc: I guess it's kind of hard for me not to be at least a little bit apathetic about the people that are here 10 years cuz if they've been here 10 years and they haven't made a big Ruckus that has it really affected my life.
Sentiment score: 2

Ben LeBlanc: I don't know.
Sentiment score: 0

Davis Wendzel: I think for me it's that the they've been here for 10 years and they haven't tried to really become part of the country.
Sentiment score: 0

Davis Wendzel: Maybe if they have started the process of becoming a citizen that's different.
Sentiment score: 1

Davis Wendzel: But these people haven't even tried to learn English or becoming too ingrained in the American culture.
Sentiment score: -1

Davis Wendzel: I just think it's hard to just let them be part of our country.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: I think the problem with that statement is the fact that if they were to try it goes back to her initial two issues if they were to say hi.
Sentiment score: -1

Grant Seiter: I'd like to become a citizen of they and they were to do so in that the Houston office and they say, oh, where do you live you live here, but you're a document that goes back to the same kind of circular problem as before they would have to be deported until their papers went through the process.
Sentiment score: 0

Grant Seiter: So in trying to become a citizen if they've already been here for 10 years, they're subject to the same legal proceedings of someone who came over yesterday.
Sentiment score: 1
