Lee Deckard: Does anybody want to discuss this or are we just going to sit here in silence?
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: Looking at a couple of these cons.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: What do we feel about some of these things where it says people are afraid to come forward because they think this will hurt their family.
Sentiment score: -1

Lee Deckard: Getting deported.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: What do we think about that?
Sentiment score: 0

Lauralee Jackson: I think that people would are definitely scared about coming forward because you wouldn't want to risk anything happening to like your family or you being deported because something happened to you and there's nothing really did it you can do about it.
Sentiment score: 0

Lauralee Jackson: And I think it also when people don't come forward because they're illegal.
Sentiment score: 1

Lauralee Jackson: It also makes these crimes like happen more frequently because they know that nothing's going to happen to them or happen to see the people that the people that caused the crime.
Sentiment score: -1

Lauralee Jackson: So that's just kind of what I think about it.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: Hi everyone.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: I think most people can agree.
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: This is not like a super black and white issue.
Sentiment score: -2

Payton Burnett: I think that's why it's so difficult to like pick up inside on or like four against but I think I think police officers should be able to do this but more so for the purpose of like getting these people on like a list for a process to become a citizen since I think our like immigration system has been so messed up and been so like lacks in the in the past.
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: And so yeah, it is kind of unfair for people who are doing it correctly.
Sentiment score: 1

Charlie Emmett: I agree with Peyton if you're already breaking the law for you.
Sentiment score: 1

Charlie Emmett: Kind of four-figure right to have protection under the law.
Sentiment score: 1

Lauralee Jackson: Your sound isn't working.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Can you hear me?
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Bertelsman: All right.
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Bertelsman: Yeah, I think the argument against is good because I've always been with the argument for like some victims are undocumented immigrants and police should.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Oh and I think police should be able to ask them questions because I mean they're already here.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Illegally.
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Bertelsman: So I think just be able to as a citizen be able to follow law follow the law.
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Bertelsman: I think you should have anything to hide so.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: But I do get the other side how that's a good good point about not coming forward.
Sentiment score: 1

Jonny Berry: Yeah, there's other things you guys are not realizing is the police officers.
Sentiment score: -1

Jonny Berry: You not realize these victims are undocumented workers when they are interviewing them.
Sentiment score: 1

Jonny Berry: So is Marvel of witch-hunt just asking can you buy the dates back to be undocumented worker if they're on the document worker?
Sentiment score: -1

Jonny Berry: That's like that's not will be like very fair to the victim because they could be her here.
Sentiment score: -1

Jonny Berry: I'm just not legally but legal legal.
Sentiment score: 1

Jonny Berry: Is he asking questions about like, what's your DACA immigration status at Sky takes away from the don't I report a crime.
Sentiment score: 2

Jonny Berry: They just got taken against.
Sentiment score: -1

Charlie Emmett: well Johnny, if they're not and documented workers then Then they have nothing to hide by reporting crimes.
Sentiment score: 2

Charlie Emmett: So your argument kind of falls on its face when you take into account that no one documented or no legal immigrant is going to have an issue with reporter.
Sentiment score: -1

Sneha Bhavanasi: I don't think it matters if it's illegal immigrant or not reporting a crime because the fact is that first of all, we want to keep our country safe and its crimes are being reported in general.
Sentiment score: 1

Sneha Bhavanasi: It's going to cause an even bigger problem and like Laura Lee said it's going to start causing people to Target people who are undocumented cuz they know that people are not going to East crimes and if that happens is just going to it's going to cause even more of a mess and a huge Target in our country.
Sentiment score: -1

Morgan Evans: I can everybody hear me.
Sentiment score: 0

Morgan Evans: Sweet.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: Yeah, I agree.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: All right.

Lee Deckard: So this one kind of confuses me, but what do you what do we think about like the fact that like what is a witness mean?
Sentiment score: -1

Lee Deckard: Does this mean like somebody that is here illegally knows that another person is here.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: Illegally, or I'm kind of confused about this.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: So if anybody could explain this to me that be great.
Sentiment score: 2

Sneha Bhavanasi: I think it's just talking about a witness to any crime.
Sentiment score: -2

Sneha Bhavanasi: So I think it's kind of the same as the victim situation where Witnesses aren't going to start speaking up if they know that they're going to get in trouble and then they're going to become targets as well.
Sentiment score: 1

Joie Hensley: Everyone hear me.
Sentiment score: 0

Joie Hensley: Yeah, so yeah, it says of a witness to a crime but we also have to take into account like what crime is actually being committed and what they're witnessing and I think that they should be allowed in certain circumstances, but it should if they're actually like testifying in court then it should be able to testify in court and then potentially go back.
Sentiment score: -1

Joie Hensley: I mean I'm kind of like on the fence about this because for certain circumstances they should be allowed but other circumstances.
Sentiment score: 1

Joie Hensley: I feel like they should have to go back to their own country.
Sentiment score: 0

Jessie Benson: I'm not really sure what it means by like Reasonable Suspicion and whether or not this allows police officers to kind of like like go on stereotypes and so I don't know I guess I'm unsure about this in terms of what reasonable suspicion means.
Sentiment score: -1

Lauralee Jackson: Yeah, I kind of feel the same thing on that.
Sentiment score: 0

Lauralee Jackson: Like I feel like they the police officer should be able to ask if like what the severity of the crime but I don't want to be like asking then have them deported like if they're able to help in this sort of like case or whatever the crime was then they should at least the police officers should try to get them some sort of documentation or help them like join the country legally that I don't know.
Sentiment score: 0

Lauralee Jackson: I'm like I see both sides of it, so it's difficult.
Sentiment score: -1

Payton Burnett: Right.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: Yeah, I agree.
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: I think it definitely does need to be addressed and it should be a lot for them to ask but I think for the purpose of getting them on a sort of list to become a legal citizen just to get rid of this problem in general cuz this is a huge issue and if it's not a dress it's like nothing's going to change.
Sentiment score: -1

Lee Deckard: We've talked about this little bit by night last Pro or talks about if that that witness could potentially be a legal Citizen and if you look at the last time that talks about increase the stress in the legal system and the other day would be deported.
Sentiment score: -1

Lee Deckard: Why do you think people are afraid to be deported even though they could possibly become a legal citizen is at this because of lack of knowledge or like what are we I'm confused why minutes little contradicted extinct
Sentiment score: 0

Sneha Bhavanasi: So especially in this country.
Sentiment score: 0

Sneha Bhavanasi: It's really hard to become a legal Citizen and if you're out of the country and you're trying to apply to come here legally it can take up to 10 years, which is pretty crazy.
Sentiment score: 1

Sneha Bhavanasi: And then if you're deported and then you tried to come here legally, it could take even longer and it's not really like a reasonable timeframe, which is why I feel like a lot of people don't even attempt to go the legal route because it's way harder than it needs to be.
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Bertelsman: So I just looked up how long it takes to be a legal US citizen.
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Bertelsman: Is it approximately six months?
Sentiment score: 0

Ryan Bertelsman: So, I mean, I don't know either way like how long it takes but I think that is another issue that could definitely be handled better.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: One time I think I see with dishes if we're just assigning somebody that too and to an immigration case like this.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: They possibly could not want to try as hard especially if they have a bias towards this type of topic.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: So that's just something that I see.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: I I think it's a good idea.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: But I feel like some people would be biased toward the situation and maybe not being fair towards the person is trying to get in.
Sentiment score: -1

Charlie Emmett: Yeah, Sue under the Constitution.
Sentiment score: -1

Charlie Emmett: Citizens are entitled to representation non-citizens or not and we owe them Noah.
Sentiment score: 0

Charlie Emmett: representation for committing Crimes by coming over here illegally
Sentiment score: -2

Morgan Evans: Maybe this will just helped me clarify the issue a little bit.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: So I'm just a little bit confused for an immigration case that that only referring to a court case whether or not they're an illegal immigrant.
Sentiment score: 0

Jonny Berry: for now, I think I believe that does just mean for cases where it be somebody who is hey illegal immigrant case.
Sentiment score: -1

Jonny Berry: I'll take it the porter.
Sentiment score: 0

Jonny Berry: Not just that kind of situation.
Sentiment score: 0

Charlie Emmett: So it looks like it's according to the second Pro hiding legal counsel for immigration proceedings to keep them here.
Sentiment score: 0

Charlie Emmett: Which would mean.
Sentiment score: 0

Sneha Bhavanasi: I think regardless I mean I understand that the constitution says that we don't owe them anything because they're not here legally and that makes sense definitely but then you also have to look at it as a thing of fairness and Justice and realize that like a lot of people who are going through these cases just don't understand what's happening.
Sentiment score: 1

Sneha Bhavanasi: Like the first pro talks about how it involves complex legal questions that a lot of undocumented immigrants don't know how to navigate and maybe representation isn't the right way to help them.
Sentiment score: 0

Sneha Bhavanasi: But I think there has to be something that we're helping them at least a little bit with
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: Yeah, I agree with sneha.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: I'm not I'm not a hundred percent sure.
Sentiment score: 0

Morgan Evans: What exactly would be the perfect solution.
Sentiment score: 2

Morgan Evans: But but I agree that it my gut feelings.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: You can't just give them no rights because they aren't citizens doesn't seem completely fair.
Sentiment score: -1

Morgan Evans: But I do agree that maybe giving him all of the same equal rights might not be a fair solution either so I'm not actually sure what to do.
Sentiment score: 1

Jessie Benson: Yeah, I agree with both of them.
Sentiment score: 1

Jessie Benson: Like there's an aspect of fairness that a taken account also, like in the beginning.
Sentiment score: 0

Jessie Benson: I think this sad like more towards like special Asylum cases.
Sentiment score: 1

Jessie Benson: So is like definitely special circumstances.
Sentiment score: 0

Jessie Benson: Where are these people are coming here illegally like for good reasons.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: Maybe of a possible.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: It's very basic solution to this would be to find a group of people who volunteer maybe to help in these cases and said just assign people in that case.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: They would be the ones that want to help them out instead of just saying or we don't deserve there or we don't we don't have to give them help maybe they're just people that want to volunteer and try to give them help just because they feel like they should
Sentiment score: 1

Charlie Emmett: Yeah, I agree with we as people want to do that on their own time.
Sentiment score: 1

Charlie Emmett: They're more than welcome to do that.
Sentiment score: 0

Charlie Emmett: I just don't think that government funds should go towards providing counsel.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: yeah, I don't I mean I definitely think that you legal immigrants should have the same rights as legal citizens, but I think I don't think you should just say, like screw all immigrants send them back, but I don't know it's kind of finding outline of like Together breaking this law is being broken.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Like what's going to be like the free pass for the for the next ball to be broken or it's kind of like well, there's leeway in this one.
Sentiment score: 1

Ryan Bertelsman: So, how can we be flexible with breaking the next law?
Sentiment score: -1

Lee Deckard: Maybe instead of because I know where all the some people are big on not having the government find this type of thing.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: So maybe instead of local government allocate in finding a less.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: That means like people donating their own money.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: What if like I said what if people just don't either on money instead of the government to he's not local nonprofits if they wanted to provide some type of legal service to these people.
Sentiment score: -1

Charlie Emmett: I think that's a really good solution to this.
Sentiment score: 2

Charlie Emmett: I'd see no reason why we should keep people from putting money where they want to put their own money.
Sentiment score: 0

Charlie Emmett: The government should be held too much higher standard on where exactly they put their money since their money is coming from citizens.
Sentiment score: 1

Charlie Emmett: It should be used to benefit citizens.
Sentiment score: 2

Lauralee Jackson: I think this is one of the topics that I had like the most problems with like trying to figure out where I was and what I thought was like right because I definitely like agree with like number 5 on the against like nonprofits have a lot of other means to raise money for like how they go about their services and I don't necessarily think that like local governments should do this may be like on a national federal level, but I'm like, well that not everyone would be able to go to like a federal or national government type thing.
Sentiment score: -2

Lauralee Jackson: So, I don't know this is where I see like her problems like local versus national debt.
Sentiment score: 2

Lee Deckard: What if there was one of the original nonprofit that was created just for this type of situation and not maybe take away money from other nonprofits that are mainly for other things besides providing on providing immigration people Legal Services.
Sentiment score: 1

Morgan Evans: How many could work but I guess then the question comes back to you or they going to be finding themselves or their should some up at the government defining them and I'm I'm I'm a little unsure on this one too.
Sentiment score: -1

Morgan Evans: But I think they I feel like local government for me my back to be a better solution than federal government just cuz it seems like an issue that might be more well handled at the local level instead of trying to handle such a big bra tissue from top down like it might be a little bit better if you do it from the local government.

Lee Deckard: I think 10 years is 10 years is a i c a short amount of time because I have heard of I've heard of where I'm from in San Antonio.
Sentiment score: 0

Lee Deckard: Obviously, there's probably people that are not citizens, but I know of some of some people that have been here for like 60 years and they they somehow make a living and they don't get themselves in trouble.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: How would you tell somebody has been here for nearly 50 60 years that well you're here legally and you need to leave but I understand that they shouldn't be here.
Sentiment score: 1

Lee Deckard: But you know, that's your basically getting ready to get rid of their whole livelihood just because you want to get rid of them.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: I think that's kind of the argument though is like the people who have been here for fifty or sixty years and haven't committed any crimes and they should be rewarded for that and not send backer should be able to feel safe about coming up coming forward and getting some kind of.
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Legal system sent their way to become a legal resident cuz I haven't committed any crimes and proved to be a good citizen.
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: Yeah, I agree with that.
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: I think just like a burning people and taking them out as completely inhumane and would disrupt a lot of people's lives.
Sentiment score: -1

Payton Burnett: But yeah, and we we like being America are the ones who?
Sentiment score: 1

Payton Burnett: Yeah, I didn't have like that.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: It didn't force like the system in the first place.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: And so since people are here.
Sentiment score: 0

Payton Burnett: I think it's a great idea to be able to provide some means for them for people are being like good citizens and contributing to society to be able to go through a process to stay here.
Sentiment score: 2

Sneha Bhavanasi: I agree with Peyton.
Sentiment score: 1

Sneha Bhavanasi: I definitely don't see a reason that it should it shouldn't have
Sentiment score: 1

Joie Hensley: I do agree that we should make like a legal pathway for citizen to her over here who are here for illegal immigrants are here for 10 years, but I think that if you guys look at the 4th to call on it says if undocumented immigrants come to the country by illegally crossing the border.
Sentiment score: -1

Joie Hensley: It is difficult for undocumented immigrant to provide evidence that they have been in the country for a specific time.
Sentiment score: -1

Joie Hensley: So, I think like that along with like not all kinds are actually like documented either or like written down.
Sentiment score: 1

Joie Hensley: So I think that that's another part where we don't know how to check those things as well.
Sentiment score: 0

Jessie Benson: I think like another issue is also where do they fall in terms of like we're legal people who are trying to get here illegally fall before then like in the line of immigration processing like who should have presidents over who's becoming a citizen?
Sentiment score: -1

Ryan Bertelsman: Matthew say something.
Sentiment score: 0

Matthew Uchida: Yeah, I agree.
