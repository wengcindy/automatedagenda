Brigitte Pawliw-Fry:I disagree with us. I think that police officers should not be allowed to inquire about the immigration status because I believe it prevents victims of crimes from coming forward and therefore having like no justice essentially.

Ronald Pritipaul:Yeah, I also agree with this premise. I am like my my parents or my mother is undocumented immigrant or was wondering I shouldn't Citizen and it was like he instilled in me from pretty young age to not go to the police. So definitely there might have been situations when I was younger where it would be better if I went to the police. So I think like not asking kind of has some pretty direct impacts.

Sam Duffy:What do you guys think when it's chilly qualifying as Reasonable Suspicion Princeton's had to have some a question being asked. Oh you can never asked upon the immigration status. I think that it's it's really important to be able to distinguish at one point. Is it necessary for instance if it was going to court or otherwise?

Brigitte Pawliw-Fry:I mean, I think police officers have a very particular role where the federal immigration officers for example are specialized to focus on immigration. And obviously I believe that I should be abolished and just in this case like police officers are thinking about like a bang laws locally not in terms of like I don't know whether or not you're undocumented. So I don't think that there is like a case where there could be need to ask anyways.

But in that regard that would probably be on September Federal like place or like a federal agent. So I really don't see a reason why I would become necessary for like victims of crimes to be Aster immigration status.

Michael Mosle:I pretty much agree. I think it's it's pretty obvious that if you think that you could get your family or yourself in trouble by going forward to reporting a crime that's going to be a clear. If you do not do that. And I think that ultimately should be the police the job of the police is to kind of make sure the crimes reported and and it's not their job to deal with immigration.

Should there be be allowed to have legal options? Like I take issue with that probably a lot of a document so you can go for taking some smaller.

Christian Badillo:So I think this is probably a good thing. Although I'm not sure 10 years is kind of seems like a long time especially for younger children open near absolute lie.

Nolan Matcovich:I definitely agree on that. I think there should be an option for staying know if you stay in the country long enough in your Society. Well enough that there should be a citizenship. I mean maybe there should be one or two maybe a few more kind of other necessary requirements on an addition to just having spent 10 years in the country because I I do I do think that that one of the consequences Raves about sort of legal immigration process and how many people would maybe just by going going insane cuz I think you could be a problem, but I think the idea itself is not about

Evan Enriques:yeah, I just wanted to point out the second Khan and like it almost seems like a double-edged sword like the fact that you might create some or intensify someone to stay so long in the country is also like I don't know. It just seems like a double-edged sword because you're incentivizes someone to stay for a certain amount of time. But you're also encouraging them to kind of stay illegally. I think there needs to be some. Some breakdown in terms of how that would work.

Akim Richards:And I'm also don't get the idea that the legal age that would be provided to an immigrant overseas. If you guys like automatic citizenship, I think there are they legal options will become the table that are probably more appropriate for the situation of renewable some contingent Visa will also be appropriate or even leave work. And so I don't think it automatically mandates citizenship there other options.

Nolan Matcovich:I think one important thing to is the briefing the trailer from talk a little bit about this but the idea that it's really hard often times for you know, if you come to the United States or any Country Weekly that interview don't have a stamp in your passport. You don't have any sort of proof that you've been in the country for 10 years. And so you don't know one hand you need to find a way to have proof that you've actually been in the country for 10 years. But then on the other hand, there's you would also need to make sure that if someone were to stay in the country for 10 years. If they have proof that they've been there for that long. The unlikely immigration enforcement officers who try to come after them after 9 before they would then become a citizen.

Isabel Maddick:Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking about. Like what happened in the case if they take all this proves that they've been here for 10 years and then are like convicted for being here is an undocumented citizen. So I definitely think it would need to have a lot of it would need to be really well. Well respected just kind of among the population definitely like legal with this one. I think it's a good option. I think it makes a lot of sense if it's done correctly.

Nolan Matcovich:Yeah, I would say one one thing. I believe it was asking about this up. One thing that I thought was an interesting news about that sort of in-between of like maybe there's like a special Visa program. We're in some other new like in between where it doesn't necessarily be to you becoming a citizen to go after someone to the equipment because maybe I don't know how I feel like many of many things in this our seem to have high stakes are to have like a lot of potential in becoming a citizen example and I think the escalating some of that I love him.
